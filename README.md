# Map Search

Map Search is a project that uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), 
[Wiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), and 
[flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) 
to let the user explore points of interest in Chicago. It uses the 
[Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) library and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 framework. 

This project started with base code from the [Udacity GitHub account](https://github.com/udacity/ud864).
